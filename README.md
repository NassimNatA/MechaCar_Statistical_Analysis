## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The linear regression results above demonstrate that the variables & coefficients that provide non-random amount of variance to the dataset are vehicle length, ground clearance, and intercept. These variables will affect the mpg values by introducing variance and other significant variables and factors not included in the model.

 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 The slope of the linear model is p = 5.35e-11, which is not considered to be a 0 value. Likewise, because the vehcile length and ground clearance have a significant affect on the variance of the dataset it cannot be assumed that the slop of the linear model should be considered 0. 
 
 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 Since the R-squared value is 0.7149, this means that 71.49% of all mpg of MechaCars prototypes are be correct with this model. This demonstrates that although the model is not 100% accurate, it effectively preditcs the mpg of MechaCar prototypes of 72% of the input which is above the majority of the data.
