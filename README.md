## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
![alt_text](https://github.com/NassimNatA/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/D1.png)
The linear regression results above demonstrate that the variables & coefficients that provide non-random amount of variance to the dataset are vehicle length, ground clearance, and intercept. These variables will affect the mpg values by introducing variance and other significant variables and factors not included in the model.
 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
